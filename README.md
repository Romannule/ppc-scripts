# Bespoke PPC scripting starts here - 16.11.19

If you dream of a future where repetitive, dullard tasks are outsourced to our thankful robot partners and the risk of spreadsheet induced carpal  tunnel is zero to none, or if you're a smart person that understands humans were build for more than reporting on a Monday morning - you can request a script by emailing doug+scripts@withseismic.com

With as much detail as possible, tell me what your task is, how you currently complete it, and what you hate about it. (E.g. 'I download a .csv from G.Ads, filter a few columns, put it into a pivot, take a screenshot then send it to mars with a 50k word summary to a manager that hasnt mastered the art of breathing through the nose'), 

I'll get back to you as soon as I can :)
